This means it has exclusive use of its frequency during certain hours, which is not common for all AM stations.\n\n2. **Transmitter Power and Coverage**: Due to its high transmitter power and Manitoba's mostly flat land with near-perfect ground conductivity, CBW reaches almost all of southern Manitoba during the day and much of the middle portion of North America at night. This extensive coverage is a distinctive feature.\n\n3. **Simulcast on Low-Power FM**: In addition to its AM broadcast, CBW is simulcast on a low-power FM station at 89.3 MHz, which adds another layer of uniqueness to its broadcasting capabilities.\n\nWhile CJOB (680 kHz) also operates with high power and has specific directional antenna requirements due to being on a clear channel frequency, the combination of CBW's class A status, extensive coverage, and simulcast feature makes it stand out as particularly unique in Manitoba.\n\nTherefore, **CBW (990 kHz)** is the AM station in Manitoba that can be considered the only one of its kind."}]}
